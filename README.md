# LSTM model
File stock_prediction is an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series prediction. It uses historical stock data to predict stock prices for a future period (365 days from today).
Please be aware that predicting stock prices in the real world requires more sophisticated methods and factors. The code uses historical data to forecast future stock values, but the precision of the forecasts varies on a number of variables, therefore it's crucial to thoroughly assess the effectiveness of the model before basing financial decisions on these forecasts.
